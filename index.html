            The UK stands out for the variety of its sporting interests. 
            Sport plays an important role in promoting integration and cultivating talent in the country. 
            The country is the birthplace of several major international sports such as football, rugby, 
            cricket, golf, tennis and also athletics. Sport is a major source of entertainment in the UK, with 
            thousands of spectators filling stadiums and arenas to cheer on their favourite teams.
            The British are very successful in many sports, for example in formula one Lewis Hamilton is a seven-time world champion, 
            or in football, they have a strong national team.

            The Uk's law is a bit different than Polish. In the Uk we drive on the left side of the road, meanwhile in poland we drive on the right side.
            In england while we crossing a street and we jump the lights and the car will hit us this is our fault. In poland in the same situation
            the driver would be punished. In england a higher blood alcohol concentration is allowed while driving a road wehicle and it is 0,8 ‰. In poland it is
            0,2‰, so we can see noticeable difference. In the Uk an oral agreement is sufficentt, you don't need to create a written agreement and they avoid
            unnesecary papers. They don't have election silence

            The UK is the cradle of famous bands and musical performers, this was particularly evident in the last century,
             which we will focus on, after the war there was a boom in many bands. It started with 'The Beatles' they were very popular.
              They broke a lot of records and created mainly rock n roll. Among the famous bands there were also "Queen", "The Rolling Stones",
               "Spice Girls", there are also solo artists like David Bowie, Elton John, Ed Sheeran, Beyonce, against the background of the Polish 
               music scene these names and band names look very strong
